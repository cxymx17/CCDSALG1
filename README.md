# Expression Evaluator Using Stacks and Queues in C

### Summary: A minimalist C calculator that parses, converts, and evaluates infix expressions using stacks and queues.

This project implements a command-line calculator that takes infix expressions, converts them to postfix notation using custom stack and queue data structures, and evaluates the result.
It supports arithmetic, relational, and logical operators, as well as parentheses for grouping. The program also detects division by zero and prints an appropriate error message. Designed with modular C code, this project demonstrates practical applications of stacks and queues for parsing and evaluating mathematical and logical expressions.
